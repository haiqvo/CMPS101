The RedBlackTree
The RedBlackTree function written in java work in the correct time. The printtree simply goes through each node and prints it in 3 different types of traversal. The means it has to travel to all of the nodes and print the key. So if the number of nodes is n traveling to all of the nodes will be O(n).  The insert also is O(log n) because it goes left of right and inserts in the right location. Find travels left or right depending on the key value being search. Both require that the pointer start at the root and travel down by comparing the value of the pointer key to the inserted or search key. This means that it will travel down one of the many paths of the tree making it O(log n). Create, successor, predecessor, printnode, min , and max are all O(1) because current_node, max, and min are already stored in global variables. Create will create a empty tree. Successor and predecessor uses current_node and moves up of down making it O(1). Max and min is O(1) because the keys are compared to the min and max before they are inserted into the tree so that calling it is O(1).
