Conway's Game Of Life
Author: Hai Vo
The assignment was to write a version of Conway's Game of Life with a algorithm of O(n). Almost all of the program runs with O(n) with the expection of the Grid part. Initializing the 2D array (createCells) and printing (printGrid) it requires requires 2 for loops making it, but the 2D array is a integer so it should got quickly. The only think that is stored in the 2D array is the index to the uninitialize array. The 2D array initializing and drawing the graph is done in 0(n^2) but the impact only occurs at the beginning. Initializing the 2D array it only needed to be done once in a single run and so should not be a problem. The rest of the program is O(n). Filling the grid (fillCells) with alive cells uses a single while loop to simply take the values from a file or stdin and fills the uninitialize alive array. Checking for neighbors and counting both neighbor and alive cells (cycleCells) is done in a single loop tha basically goes through all of the uninitializes alive cell arrays and inputs all of the neighbors into a uninitializes neighbor cell arrays.To increases efficiency the count for all the alive and neighbor cells are also done while checking for neighbor. Once all the neighbors and alive cells are counted the rules of the game come into play (ruling) it uses single loops to check for cases in the uninitialize alive array and uninitialize neighbor array. After the rules are done it needs to refresh the count and clear the uninitialize neighbor array. It is done in one for loop. Overall with the exception to the beginning the program running in O(n). 

How to run:
1. The is a Makefile so type "make all" should compile the program.
2. Next type "java GameOfLife (a input file)" to run the program.
*the program takes a input file as an agruement*
*the display is on the console*
*In GameOfLife there is a variable called gridsize which controls the size of the grid right now it is defaulted to 30*
